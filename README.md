## Motivation

* In static systems, high mutation rates create a pressure for gene overlap and smaller genomes
* However, more modular, separated genetic architectures have been shown to be more evolvable in previous work
* Furthermore, in evolutionary biology, we see a general trend of larger essential genomes in more complex organisms
* Therefore, _what environmental pressures have selected for modular, evolvable genetic architectures in biological systems?_

## System Model

* NK-Inspired landscape
* Variable length genomes
