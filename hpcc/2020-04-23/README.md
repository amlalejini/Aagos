- Pivot mutation rate: 0.003
- Pivot change rates: 64, 2, 0
- Fitness models: gradient model & nk model
- At anchor points, gene counts: 8, 16, 32 (shift starting genome size appropriately)
- Random drift treatment for each mutation rate, gene count, & starting genome size
  - + turn selection on after 50k generations of drift! TODO
- Large replicate count: 100
