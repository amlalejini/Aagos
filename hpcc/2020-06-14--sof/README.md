Experimental design overview

- First, evolve organisms at low mutation rate and at high mutation rate (for both static and changing
  environments & drift).
- Next, randomly pair low mutation rate architectures w/high mutation rate architectures. Compete
  in both a high mutation rate environment and a low mutation rate environment. Lock down genetic
  architectures (gauging the evolvability of the architectures).
